# Interactive Rating Component

This is a solution to the [Interactive Rating Component Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI) on Frontend Mentor. It's a great project to practice DOM manipulation and conditional rendering with JavaScript.

## 🔧 Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox

## ✨ What I Learned

This challenge helped me understand conditional rendering in JavaScript by toggling between the rating state and the thank you state. I also focused on improving my CSS layout skills.

## 🧠 Continued Development

In future iterations, I plan to:
